# Garage A Checker Front End

User interface for the garage A checker website.

## How it's built

Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Uses the Firebase RESTful API to get the garage data saved by the backend.

## Why build this?

Mostly because I thought it would be funny. I used the back end to practice working with Firebase and Heroku with Python, and I needed a User Interface to go along with it.
